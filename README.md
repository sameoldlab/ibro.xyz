Hi, this is just a "blog". It's open source for the changelog and I guess if someone's really curious about my basic astro project. 

## Licenses 
Code is mostly copied from Astro docs.
Licensing ideas I'd like to spread seems counterintuitive. Remix what you want (everything is a remix, anyway). Attribution would be nice (assuming I write something original) but not neccessary, just don't go resell everything for profit? 

## Credits
Astro for making this simple
Thanks to [John Eaton](https://github.com/johneatmon) for looking after widows and orphans
