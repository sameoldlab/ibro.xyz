Hi, this is just a "blog". It's open source for the changelog and I guess if someone's really curious about my basic~~ astro~~ svelte site 

## Licenses 
Code is mostly copied.
Licensing ideas I'd like to spread seems counterintuitive, so remix what you want (everything is a remix, anyway). Attribution would be nice (assuming I write something original) but not neccessary, just don't go resell everything for profit?
