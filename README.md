Hi, this is just a "blog". It's open source for the changelog and ig if someone's really curious about my basic astro project. 

## Licences 
Code is mostly copied from Astro docs.
Licensing ideas I'd like to spread seems counterintuitive. Remix what you want (everything is a remix, anyway). Attribution would be cool, and don't go resell for profit or something stupid. 

## Credits
Thanks to [John Eaton](https://github.com/johneatmon) for looking after widows and orphans
