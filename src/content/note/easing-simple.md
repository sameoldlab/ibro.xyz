Link to Rich Hickey talk. You should see it. It's a good talk.

I don't think the title atually fits though. Hickey focuses on the difference between simple and complex (or complected, as he put it). Simple gets a passing mention at the beggining in comparicon to hard, when we talk about the approcahbility or failiarity of a new system. But after that his main case is not for easyness, in use or while building, but for simple. 

- I make the case that simple often gets abandoned for complex, because the complex system has put more effort into providing easyness
- You can't really ignore this, because you end up in the same ecosystem as the people making these choices. My messaging app is decided by the majority of people I need to talk to. The speed I can work, my productivity, depends on the tools which are available to me, my language, framework, operating system, and even hardware of choice. 
- so there are a lot of benefits in pushing others toward simple if I do not want to import their complexity into my life. And this *tada* means making simple easy.

- Well, now I've clearly convinced you there's a benefit, where does the problem come from, why do sim
- and here are a couple examples where the alternative happens
	- lazygit: how do you abstract away a tool, in a way that provides training wheels instead of crutches?
	- clojure: let's do functional programming, but on the JVM
