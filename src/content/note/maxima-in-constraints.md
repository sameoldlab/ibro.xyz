Disclaimer: I'm going to borrow some language from Optimization Theory, which I only have a cursory understanding of (sorry).

Most people would agree that protocols are a good thing. They scale emergent activity by helping to coordinate base expectations. Without any kinds of protocols, laws, or standards, our society--if you could still call it that--would be chaos. Yet an over-reliance, or maybe over growth, of protocols also leads to problems. When we set too many constraints, our systems become fragile; likely to break themselves or their participants. Is there a definition for where this drop of point is, or would something so specific fall into the same trap? Maybe a better analogy would come from baking. Stir the batter <span class="extravagance">✨just right✨</span>, so your gluten might develop, but **DO NOT OVER-MIX**. 

And here we see the question return, what does an over-mixed cupcake look like? Its traits, the warning signals at the edge of danger? Who up adding regression tests into their flour integration? 

I do not have answers to these questions--for protocols *or* cupcakes. Perhaps one approach might be to start with an outcome. Is the protocol sufficiently adequate to fulfill your initial goal? If so, perhaps it's time to stop tweaking, back away slowly, and let it run. And repeat for the next target. A few small batches rather than one big failure.
