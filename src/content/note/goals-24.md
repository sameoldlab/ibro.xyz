I want to make a ton of ~~apps~~ data processors this year. Find a nice stack that can builds cross platform. I know browsers and terminals are the usual platforms for this but, there has to be more right? What's going on with these triangles over in GPU land. 
2023 was a lot of webdev, but after spending a week debugging why my HTML-like JS compiler isn't producing the HTML and Javascript I expect--sorry Svelte... a little break would be nice.
Got a demo open as I write this for a bevy WASM project doing realtime P2P sync in a browser. There might be too much cruft there but it feels different. 
Want to figure out an answer to this mess:
- Makepad and GPUI are too early
- Tauri cross-platform is "difficult" to test or distribute
- Slint seems mostly focused on embedded
- Zig overall changes too much (which imo is good actually long term)
- "The" rust WebGPU crate is LARGE, maybe I don't really need compute shaders?
- There's a MySQLite wasm layer over IndexedDB, which was based on MySQLite, to make it faster?
- CRDTs???????????????????
- Not sure if all the libraries are psyops...
- Maybe this is a good year to ignore libraries for a while

## Todo: 

- Query builder meets social media aggregator, for whatever value social media still has
- Local desktop caching app for Omnivore
- Local-first are.na 
- TUI version of Visor
- video riff on Amelia's prompting article ( thing about taking AI prompts from teletype to at least Fish shell )
- many, many, many shader sketches
- [x] ~~Find/make scrolling window manager (or plugin) that works with Wayland and Arch~~ Niri
- [x] update this bloody website
- Dark-mode PRs for more websites :P
