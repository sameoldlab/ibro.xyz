Product and UX don't need to be in conflict with privacy. Gabriel Valdivia's case study for [Tonic ](https://www.gabrielvaldivia.com/essays/case-study-tonic) had a thoughtful approach to tailoring recommendations without resorting to tracking and storing user data. There was a <span class="extravagance">framework</span> to go along with it too:

[Into the Bytecode #13](https://intothebytecode.xyz/henri-stern-privy/) with Henri Stern talk balancing protocol-product and control vs convenience. Having and maintaining transparent communication about progressing toward decentralization. 

I wish I didn't need to think about this so often, but [On Weaponised Design](https://newdesigncongress.org/en/pub/on-weaponised-design) continues being relevant to recent events, both "good" and "bad". A slightly depressing--but necessary--look at how design assumptions impact end user security.
