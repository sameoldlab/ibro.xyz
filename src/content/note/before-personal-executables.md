Metamask Snaps and Solana xNFTs have a lot of similarity to Urbit. Or rather they're all converging on something that seems to be new paradigm, till you remember the "good ol' days" downloading programs that *just ran* on your computer. Throw in a node, local hosting, and some privacy then someone could start marketing this as web0.5. I say this but also downloading and installing 30-50MB executables before using DeFi is (currently) horrendous UX so... who knows. It does feel like there's something stupid simple between PWAs, IPFS, and/or Docker to make this significantly more usable. more "malleable, yet secure": [@agoric](https://twitter.com/agoric)hardened js, rsms' [@playbit_](https://twitter.com/playbit_)Fedora Silverblue (Immutable file systems + sand-boxed applications)

Few try to fix it cause incentives. Everything is expected to lead to protocol value capture. Without better relationship altruistic attempts will be unsustainable, so either:
1. full stack centralizes around brands (road to FAANG) or 
2. app layer will find ways to extract more value

## Frontend  Censorship
Uncensorable frontend overlaps a lot with contract verification. Asking "how can I use the contract at 0x1aBf..." rather than "how can I access the interface at dapp . com" might lead to some interesting solutions. People mostly want carry out some action without getting rugged. I think, it's close-ish to what aggregators do now. "Wallets" like Argent, Omni, or Frontier are the "50 MB executables" that make accessing some contracts simpler. This isn't to discount Sia/Arweave/IPFS + ENS/HNS approach; still very valuable to actually reach information. Or xNFT/byoa/snaps the very early, potential secret third things. Or the synergies of combining them. Worth looking at ArcBrowser Boosts, Obsidian plugins, or Urbit (yes again) for how network effects of iterations on UI might make data (contracts) more useful. minimal fragmentation, high customization etc. If the bars low enough might not need to worry too much about incentives.
