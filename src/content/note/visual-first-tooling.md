I think I'm more optimistic about visualizations on top existing languages than visual first tools. OpenMFX is trying to reunite nodes in Blender, Houdini, and other tools, but that's one(?) guy. And then there's legal overhead bc people used different licences over the exact same subd and Gaussian blur libraries. Same story with every A/V editing tool repackaging ffmpeg as a subscription. (I am extremely happy that all this stuff existed at some point BTW). 
Just thinking how it can be better. Main benefit I get from visual tools is liveness, feedback, and an expanded library. A lot of that (not all tho) could fit in a text UI. And for the rest, there's GUIs like @nodes_io and @theatre_js that just sit on top.There's a whole minefield picking tools now bc you don't want to get work stuck a random format, but imagine if C4D was like Sublime Text, Houdini was JetBrains, Blender was neovim. (accidentally did another modular maxing, Data as a Protocol pitch)
