Reading more [about service workers](https://philipwalton.com/articles/smaller-html-payloads-with-service-workers/) after round-tripping from `SvelteKit -> Eleventy -> Astro -> SvelteKit` (not because one was "better" than the other, still has tradeoffs). With MPAs (Multi-page Apps) the chossing a cache strategy usually involved deciding if it was worth saving each pages. Then to get a list of cached pages:


```js
caches.keys().then((keys) => {
	keys.forEach(async (k) => {
		const cache = await caches.open(k)
		const keys = await cache.keys()
		console.log(keys)
		pages.push(
			...keys.filter(
				(k) => k.url.includes('html') 
					&& !k.url.includes('offline.html')
			)
		)
	})
})
```

With the Client-side Routing from SvelteKit, that tradeoff is gone. Individual components get saved separately, so I can cache the `lab/[slug].js` file needed to create this page once and then only request and save`content.json` to display these words without downloading an identical copy of Nav, Next/Prev, or `<head>` again.
